Wireshark-for-OpenWSN
=====================

Wireshark dissector for OpenWSN

What's in
---------
- Wireshark v.10
- Built-in dissector : quick and very dirty version
- Empty plugin

Work status
-----------
	- Integration of P. de Mil code on wireshark built-in dissector (adaptation to recent wireshark code)
	- Investigations and code adaptation to other related protocol (6lowpan, etc)

All major changes are made but nothing is play on capture. All we have is the informations in menu bar -> internals -> Disscetor tables
												  		    -> Supported protocols 
802.15.4e appears!

WIP

Have look to dissector-development-wip.md (in French).
